# Exploring and Filtering Data
## Completed as part of Udacity's data analysis nanodegree.

In this project the aim was to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States; Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

Bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price.

Python and relevant libraries were used in conjunction to import data from files in csv format and to perform statistical analysis on each city based on the user's choice. An interactive environment was created to ask filter questions and thereby take raw input from the user to return filtered analysis report.
